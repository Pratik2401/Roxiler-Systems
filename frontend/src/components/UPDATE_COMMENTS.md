## Professional Comment Standards Applied

1. **Component Description**: Each component starts with a JSDoc comment describing its purpose and functionality
2. **Function Documentation**: Key functions have descriptive comments explaining their purpose
3. **Removed Unnecessary Comments**: Removed obvious inline comments like `// Main Content Area`
4. **Consistent Style**: Professional, concise comments that add value without cluttering code

## Example Professional Comment Format

```jsx
/**
 * Component Name - Brief description of component purpose
 * Additional details about functionality and use cases
 */
const ComponentName = () => {
  /**
   * Function description explaining what it does
   */
  const functionName = () => {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```
